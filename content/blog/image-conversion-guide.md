# Image Format Conversion Guide

Choosing the right image format is crucial for web performance, quality, and compatibility. This guide explains when to use each format and how to convert between them.

## Format Comparison

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- **Best for**: Icons, logos, graphics with transparency
- **Pros**: Lossless compression, supports transparency
- **Cons**: Larger file sizes for photos

### JPG/JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- **Best for**: Photographs, complex images
- **Pros**: Small file sizes, universal support
- **Cons**: Lossy compression, no transparency

### WebP
- **Best for**: Web images (modern browsers)
- **Pros**: Superior compression, supports transparency
- **Cons**: Limited legacy browser support

### GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
- **Best for**: Simple animations, very simple graphics
- **Pros**: Animation support, small files for simple images
- **Cons**: Limited to 256 colors

## When to Convert

| From | To | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| PNG | WebP | Reduce file size for web |
| JPG | PNG | Need transparency |
| GIF | WebP | Better animation quality |
| BMP | PNG/JPG | Universal compatibility |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep originals** - Always save source files before converting
2. **Match format to use case** - Photos → JPG, Graphics → PNG
3. **Consider browser support** - Use WebP with fallbacks
