# Image Format Conversion Guide: Performance & Quality

Choosing the right image format is one of the simplest ways to improve your website's PageSpeed Insights score and overall user experience. At Kleinbyte, our engineering team processes millions of images, and we've compiled this authoritative guide to help you choose the right format every time.

## Detailed Format Comparison

Understanding the technical characteristics of each format is key to **Expertise**.

| Format | Compression | Transparency | Animation | Best For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **JPG** | Lossy | No | No | High-detail photographs |
| **PNG** | Lossless | Yes | No | Logos, icons, screenshots |
| **WebP** | Both | Yes | Yes | Modern web assets |
| **AVIF** | Both | Yes | Yes | The future of web images (Smallest) |
| **SVG** | Vector | Yes | Yes | Illustrations, simple icons |

## The "Big Three" for the Modern Web

### 1. WebP: The Standard
WebP is now supported by almost all modern browsers. It offers 26% smaller file sizes compared to PNGs and 25-34% smaller than JPEGs at equivalent quality.
- **Internal Tip**: Use WebP for fallback support if you aren't ready for AVIF.

### 2. AVIF: The Compression King
AVIF is the newest player, offering even better compression than WebP. It's often 20% smaller than WebP for the same visual quality.
- **Expert Insight**: AVIF is perfect for hero images where every kilobyte counts toward your **Core Web Vitals**.

### 3. SVG: Infinite Scalability
For logos and icons, never use raster formats (PNG/JPG). SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) uses XML code, meaning it stays perfectly sharp at any resolution.

## When to Convert: Strategic Use Cases

| From | To | Goal | Why it works |
|------|-----|------|--------------|
| **Any** | **WebP** | Performance | Drastically reduces page load time. |
| **JPG** | **PNG** | Editing | Preserves quality during repeated saves. |
| **PNG** | **JPG** | Storage | Better for photos without transparency. |
| **GIF** | **WebP** | Animation | Much smaller file size with better colors. |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will converting JPG to PNG improve quality?
No. Converting a "lossy" format (JPG) to a "lossless" one (PNG) won't bring back lost detail, but it will prevent *further* degradation during editing.

### Is WebP better than PNG?
For the web, yes. WebP supports transparency like PNG but at a much smaller file size.

### Should I use AVIF yet?
Yes, but always provide a WebP or JPG fallback for older browsers using the `<picture>` tag.

### How do I convert images for free?
Use our [Image Converter](/tools/image-converter) for fast, private, and high-quality conversions between all major formats.
