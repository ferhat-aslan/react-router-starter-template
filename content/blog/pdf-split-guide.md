# How to Split PDF Files by Pages

Need to extract specific pages from a PDF? Our free PDF splitter makes it easy to separate pages or create new documents from existing PDFs.

## Common Use Cases

- **Extract chapters** from lengthy documents
- **Remove unwanted pages** from PDFs
- **Create separate files** from multi-page scans
- **Share only relevant sections** with others

## How to Split PDFs

### Method 1: Keep Specific Pages
Enter page ranges like "1-3,5,8-10" to extract only those pages.

### Method 2: Remove Unwanted Pages
Select "Remove" mode to delete specified pages and keep everything else.

## Page Range Format

| Format | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `1-5` | Pages 1 through 5 |
| `1,3,5` | Only pages 1, 3, and 5 |
| `1-3,7-9` | Pages 1-3 and 7-9 |

## Best Practices

1. **Know your page numbers** - Preview the PDF first
2. **Use ranges for efficiency** - "1-50" is faster than listing each page
3. **Verify the result** - Check the output before sharing
