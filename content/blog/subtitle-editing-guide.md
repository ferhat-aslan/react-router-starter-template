# Working with Subtitles: SRT, VTT, and ASS Formats

Subtitles make video content accessible to wider audiences. Whether you're translating, timing, or reformatting subtitles, understanding the different formats is essential.

## Subtitle Formats Explained

### SRT (SubRip Subtitle)
The most common subtitle format. Simple text-based format with timing information.

```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, welcome to this video.
```

### VTT (WebVTT)
Web-optimized format, commonly used for HTML5 video.

```
WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, welcome to this video.
```

### ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha)
Feature-rich format supporting styling, positioning, and effects.

## Common Tasks

### Editing Subtitles
- Correct timing issues
- Fix typos and translation errors
- Adjust synchronization

### Converting Between Formats
- SRT to VTT for web use
- ASS to SRT for compatibility
- VTT to SRT for video editors

### Merging Subtitles
- Combine multiple language tracks
- Merge split subtitle files
- Add time offsets

## Tips for Better Subtitles

1. **Keep lines short** - 40 characters max per line
2. **Proper timing** - 1-7 seconds per subtitle
3. **Check sync** - Preview with video before exporting
